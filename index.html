                        I don't love you anymore
                        A pretty line that I adore
                        Five words that I've heard before
                        'Cause you keep me on a rope
                        And tied a noose around my throat
                        You're gone, then back at my door
                        'Cause if you're gonna leave
                        Better leave, better do it fast
                        Can't live a little longer
                        Sitting on your lap
                        'Cause you know what you're doing
                        When you're coming back
                        And I don't want to have
                        Another heart attack
                        Oh, I can't be
                        Your lover on a leash
                        Every other week
                        When you please
                        Oh, I can't be
                        The kiss that you don't need
                        The lie between your teeth
                        The cut that always bleeds
                        The cut that always bleeds
                        Say you love somebody new
                        And beat my heart, to black and blue
                        Then they leave, and it's me
                        You come back to
                        To say you loved me all along
                        And kissed the bruises 'til they're gone
                        Bittersweet, 'cause I can't breathe
                        Inside your arms
                        'Cause if you're gonna leave
                        Better leave, better do it fast
                        Can't live another minute
                        Bleeding from my back
                        'Cause I don't have another one
                        For you to stab
                        And I don't want to have
                        Another heart attack
                        Oh I can't be
                        Your lover on a leash
                        Every other week
                        When you please
                        Oh, I can't be
                        The kiss that you don't need
                        The lie between your teeth
                        The cut that always bleeds
                        The cut that always bleeds
                        But even though you're killing me
                        I, I need you like the air I breathe
                        I need, I need you more than me
                        I need you more than anything
                        Please, please
                        'Cause I could be
                        Your lover on a leash
                        Every other week
                        When you please
                        Oh, I could be
                        Anything you need
                        As long as you don't leave
                        The cut that always
